The control they give the programmer to repeat blocks of code an arbitrary number of times is powerful and, once fully grasped, easy to become reliant on. This may be one reason that higher-order functions seem complex. In truth, they don\'t offer the programmer anything they couldn\'t already achieve with a simple loop, so the impetus to learn them is weak at best. However, what they lack in additional functionality is more than made up for with code clarity.\xa0\n"Indeed, the ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1.

Martin, Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship\nPer the above, clarity to the reader is of premium importance when writing code; even when that reader is only likely to be your future self.\nHow much clarity is truly gained for the reader when using higher-order functions rather than their more 'simple' looping cousins?

In Yacht a player rolls 5 dice and can retain as many or few as they choose while rerolling a maximum of two more times. The objective by the third roll is to have a point-scoring combination of dice between those retained and those just rolled. There are numerous ways to score points but largely they resemble poker hands that may be more familiar: full house, four of a kind, straights, etc. With the most points being awarded for a "Yacht" i.e. all 5 dice showing the same number.\xa0\nIt will be the task of JavaScript\'s higher-order functions to aid us in discovering which, if any, of the point-scoring combinations the player is eligible to take.\nThe 5 dice will be referred to as a hand and encoded as an array of numbers generated by a rollDice() function (which we will come to later).'),p("h4",null,"Array.prototype.forEach()"),p("p",null,"The first thing we might like to be able to do is to log each of the dice in the hand to the console (or ideally render them in an appealing way in the window)."),p("p",null,"With a familiar for-loop, this can easily be achieved.For a case as simple as this it is relatively clear to see what has been intended by the writer.
